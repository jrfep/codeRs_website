<strong>Abstract</strong> Spatial data is essential for understanding many phenomena in natural and social sciences, and maps are used in a variety of fields to visualise data and results in an appealing and interpretive way. I have been dealing with spatial data with (and without) R for nearly 20 years, using a variety of packages and approaches that have evolved over time, regularly finding challenges and new solutions. In this workshop I will demostrate how current integration of R with external libraries like leaflet or plotly make interactive mapping easier (and nicer!) than ever. <strong>Bio</strong> Jos√© Rafael Ferrer-Paris (a.k.a. JR) is currently Research Fellow at the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW and the UNSW Data Science Hub, and a member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Thematic Group on Red List of Ecosystems. JR has studied and worked in Venezuela, Germany and South Africa with biodiversity data, spatial and temporal ecological data and geographical information systems. He is currently working with Prof. David Keith on global risk assessment of ecosystems. He has been using R since version 1.0.0, and also likes working with other command, scripting and programming languages like PHP, Bash, Python, JS, Java or Perl and all kinds of databases (SQL, XML, Graphs, etc).
